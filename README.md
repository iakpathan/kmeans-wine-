# KMeans CLustering on Wine Dataset
KMeans is an unsupervised algorithm that groups data into clusters based on feature similarity. It can be used to discover patterns in the data.

We use KMeans to cluster the wine data into 3 clusters (as there are 3 types of wine in the dataset).

We visualize the clusters using the first two features for simplicity.
